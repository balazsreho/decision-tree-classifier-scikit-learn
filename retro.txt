# What was new
- gitpod.io +1
- first time with ML +1
- leading a session for ML mob programming
- Data structures (tree)
- sklearn

# What was learned
- gitpod.io +1
--      great alternative to notebooks or VScode live
--      no need to set up new VMs
- Even if I am unfamiliar I can still do some kind of skill
- sklearn

# What can be improved?
- Unclear how testing works in ML +1
--      what was the validated data vs dummy data?
--      How do we connect the process and testing frameworks between validated data vs ML model outputs?
---         Confirming that models can at least handle validated/confirmed outputs by entering confirmed 
            outputs as inputs
---         Building a simulator with underlying assumptions for testing
- How would a larger grid affect combinations and give more data inputs for training?
- Is there a different data structure we could use instead of list of lists?
- How could we change the data structure if we were midway into a testing model?
- More uniform experience level? How would this change things?
- Nice to learn how to test third party dependencies
